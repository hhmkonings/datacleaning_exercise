To get you started, you can examine (and experiment with) this example. Go to the School of Data(https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-spreadsheets/). 
Using a spreadsheet to clean up a dataset webpage, read the article and examine how in this tutorial 5 data cleaning problems are solved. Also, see if you can relate this to the data quality criteria.

# Exercise
This exercise focusses on Data Cleaning, one of the activities comprising the Data Preparation. Before cleaning data, you need to establish the data quality required and to what 'rules' and conventions the data has to comply. Make sure you study the materials of Data Cleaning to know what data quality means and how to come up with a 'cleaning' approach for your data.

Now we ask you to solve these problems using your Python skills. You can submit the the results and your explanation in an exported notebook (either .pdf, .html or .doc format). Make sure that you add text (not only #comments, but structured your notebook using Markup cells) and explain:
- What 'rules' or convention did you deduct from the data
- How do you find exceptions/violations to this rule
- What actions do you take to clean the data (fix the violations
- Explain if there are consequences to this cleaning action (and explain).
